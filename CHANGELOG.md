# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Replace the copy-ready GitHub Action tag example with the verified immutable
  `v0.1.0` commit and enforce that contract in the publisher gate.
- Add an owner-repairable release workflow and make all four archives byte-reproducible with `SHA256SUMS`.
- Build the composite Action from its pinned source revision so it no longer requires unavailable release binary assets.
- Mirror the publisher's tracked-file, payload-size, credential-path, and credential-content limits in the local release gate.

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

- Add one CI release gate for race tests, dependency licenses, secret patterns, and a timed clean-checkout quickstart.
