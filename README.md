# gha-concurrency-cycle

Detect a GitHub Actions reusable-workflow deadlock before you push it.

When a caller and a same-repository called workflow both use a group such as `release-${{ github.workflow }}`, GitHub evaluates `github.workflow` in the called workflow as the caller's workflow name. Both runs can therefore request the same workflow-level concurrency group while the caller is waiting for the callee.

`gha-concurrency-cycle` is a focused, read-only preflight. It does not run workflows, call GitHub, read secrets, or replace a general Actions linter.

## Installation

Install the published `v0.1.1` release with Go 1.26 or later:

```sh
go install github.com/kentomk/gha-concurrency-cycle/cmd/gha-concurrency-cycle@v0.1.1
```

From a source checkout, the equivalent command is:

```sh
go install ./cmd/gha-concurrency-cycle
```

## Quick start

Requires Go 1.26 or later for a source checkout.

```sh
go run ./cmd/gha-concurrency-cycle check --root testdata/conflict-basic
```

Expected first useful output:

```text
GCC001 .github/workflows/gateway.yml:6 -> .github/workflows/worker.yml:7 via .github/workflows/gateway.yml:11: effective concurrency group "release-Release Gateway" is held by the caller and requested by the called workflow; keep concurrency ownership in the caller and remove it from the called workflow
```

The command exits `1` when it finds a collision, `0` when it finds none, and `2` for invalid input. Check the safe counterpart:

```sh
go run ./cmd/gha-concurrency-cycle check --root testdata/safe-caller-only
```

## CLI

```text
gha-concurrency-cycle check [--format text|json] [--root PATH]
gha-concurrency-cycle version
```

JSON output uses schema version 1 and includes `diagnostics` and `unknowns` arrays. Paths are repository-root-relative.

## GitHub Action

Copy this workflow into `.github/workflows/concurrency-preflight.yml`. The
checkout step is required: the analyzer reads the caller repository from the
workspace.

```yaml
name: Concurrency preflight
on:
  pull_request:
  push:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@34e114876b0b11c390a56381ad16ebd13914f8d5 # v4
      - uses: kentomk/gha-concurrency-cycle@de54781570e1255f8cab65d84fdd34a27371fe85 # v0.1.1
        with:
          root: .
```

Both Action references use immutable commits. The comments record their reviewed
releases; the 40-character SHAs are the security boundaries. The composite
Action pins `actions/setup-go` to an immutable commit and Go `1.26.5`, builds the
CLI from the checked-out Action source, and runs the same exit contract documented
above. CI and release workflows use the same reviewed Go patch. It supports GitHub-hosted Linux
and macOS runners; Windows and self-hosted runners are outside the v0.1 support
contract.

For a standalone install, use the source release with:

```sh
go install github.com/kentomk/gha-concurrency-cycle/cmd/gha-concurrency-cycle@v0.1.1
```

The repository also includes `scripts/install.sh` for checksum-verified archive
installation in CI or a shell environment. It accepts only numeric `X.Y.Z`
release versions and fails before any download or file creation for other input.

The release also provides checksum-indexed Linux and macOS archives for amd64
and arm64. Download them from the [v0.1.1 release](https://github.com/kentomk/gha-concurrency-cycle/releases/tag/v0.1.1) and verify the selected archive before extraction:

```sh
archive=gha-concurrency-cycle_v0.1.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
grep "  ${archive}$" SHA256SUMS | sha256sum --check --strict -
tar -xzf "$archive"
./gha-concurrency-cycle version
```

On macOS, use `shasum -a 256 --check -` instead of `sha256sum --check --strict -`.
Checking only the selected manifest row lets you verify one downloaded archive
without first downloading the other three platform archives.

## Supported in this increment

- Workflow files directly under `.github/workflows/`
- Same-repository `uses: ./.github/workflows/<file>` calls
- Explicit top-level workflow names
- Workflow-level concurrency groups made from literals and `${{ github.workflow }}`
- `.yml` and `.yaml`

Dynamic expressions, cross-repository workflows, job-level concurrency, automatic fixes, and general syntax/security linting are intentionally out of scope. Unsupported expressions are listed in the JSON `unknowns` array and are not reported as collisions. Malformed YAML, repository-root path escapes, and symbolic links at `.github`, `.github/workflows`, or workflow files are rejected with exit `2`. A symbolic link supplied explicitly as the repository root is resolved once and reported as its canonical path.

To keep local checks bounded, one scan accepts at most 256 workflow files and 1 MiB per workflow file. Inputs above either limit are rejected with exit `2`.

## Privacy and safety

The CLI runs locally without network access or telemetry. It reads only workflow files under the selected repository root and never modifies them. Do not mutate or replace the selected directory tree while a scan is running.

## Development

```sh
scripts/release-gate.sh
```

The release gate runs formatting, race-enabled tests, vet, dependency-license and secret policy checks, Action/package smoke tests, and the 60-second quickstart from a clean Git archive.

## Uninstall

Delete the downloaded binary, or remove the binary installed by `go install` from your Go bin directory. The tool creates no configuration or state.
